romeo_moveit_actions
====================

The package allows to perform simple actions with MoveIt! configured for Romeo, NAO, and Pepper robots.

It offers a set of functionalities, like: 
  * pick and place objects,
  * reach and grasp objects,
  * test a target space for reaching and grasping,
  * manage objects
      * virtual objects: add, move, remove,
      * detect objects with the robot's sensors: call ORK Linemod object recognition.

How it works
============

For a simulator (example for Romeo robot)
-------------------

Launch MoveIt!:

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch romeo_moveit_config demo.launch

Wait until the robot model is loaded and launch moveit_simple_actions:

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch romeo_moveit_actions actions_romeo_sim.launch

Welcome to the world of simple actions! Now, you can add virtual objects or detect real objects and reach/grasp/place them !


For a real robot (example for Romeo robot)
--------------------------------

Launch the dcm_bringup (providing the robot's IP):

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch romeo_dcm_bringup romeo_dcm_bringup_remote.launch robot_ip:=<ROBOT_IP>

Launch MoveIt!:

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch romeo_moveit_config moveit_planner.launch
    
Wait until the robot model is loaded and launch moveit_simple_actions:
    
.. code-block:: bash
    
    roslaunch romeo_moveit_actions actions_romeo.launch
        
Welcome to the world of simple actions! Now, you can add virtual objects or detect real objects and reach/grasp/place them !
